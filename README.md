# uSpy
Our application is intended for all ages. It's a 4 player multiplayer mobile game where the creator of the game session decides what items the other players are to find. The players use the application to take photos of the items they're looking for. Using Google Vision API, the camera will detect wether the item is indeed a match to what the 'Spy Master' listed. The first player to find all the items wins.

Motivation:
Our motivation for this app was to utilize advanced camera recognition technology to create a fun game to be used for recreation, but also education. We have a passion for joy and learning, and this application gives users the oppurtunity to get out, explore and learn about their environment whilst using stunning technology provided by Google.
